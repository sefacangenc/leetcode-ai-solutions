Sure, let me walk you through the function call stack and how recursion works step by step for the example input nums = [1, 2, 3].

We start by calling backtrack(nums, [], result, 0) from the subsets function. 
This sets up the initial values for the recursion, with an empty path, an empty result list, 
and a starting index of 0.
Inside the backtrack function, we append the empty path to the result list: result.append(path). 
This adds the empty subset [] to the result list.
We then enter a loop to explore all possible paths that can be built from the remaining elements starting at index 0. The first element in nums is 1, so we call backtrack(nums, [1], result, 1).
Inside this new call to backtrack, we append the current path [1] to the result list: result.append(path). This adds the subset [1] to the result list.
We then enter another loop to explore all possible paths that can be built from the remaining elements starting at index 1. The second element in nums is 2, so we call backtrack(nums, [1, 2], result, 2).
Inside this new call to backtrack, we append the current path [1, 2] to the result list: result.append(path). This adds the subset [1, 2] to the result list.
We then enter another loop to explore all possible paths that can be built from the remaining elements starting at index 2. The third element in nums is 3, so we call backtrack(nums, [1, 2, 3], result, 3).
Inside this new call to backtrack, we append the current path [1, 2, 3] to the result list: result.append(path). This adds the subset [1, 2, 3] to the result list.
The loop for this call to backtrack is now complete, so we return to the previous call with path=[1, 2].
We now move to the next iteration of the loop for this call to backtrack, which explores all possible paths that can be built from the remaining elements starting at index 2. The third element in nums is 3, so we call backtrack(nums, [1, 3], result, 2).
Inside this new call to backtrack, we append the current path [1, 3] to the result list: result.append(path). This adds the subset [1, 3] to the result list.
The loop for this call to backtrack is now complete, so we return to the previous call with path=[1].
We now move to the next iteration of the loop for this call to backtrack, which explores all possible paths that can be built from the remaining elements starting at index 1. The second element in nums is 2, so we call backtrack(nums, [2], result, 2).
Inside this new call to backtrack, we append the current path [2] to the result list: result.append(path). This adds the subset [2] to the result list.
We then enter another loop to explore all possible paths that can be built from the remaining elements starting

We then enter another loop to explore all possible paths that can be built from the remaining elements starting at index 2. The third element in nums is 3, so we call backtrack(nums, [2, 3], result, 3).
Inside this new call to backtrack, we append the current path [2, 3] to the result list: result.append(path). This adds the subset [2, 3] to the result list.
The loop for this call to backtrack is now complete, so we return to the previous call with path=[2].
We now move to the next iteration of the loop for this call to backtrack, which explores all possible paths that can be built from the remaining elements starting at index 3. Since there are no more elements in nums, this loop completes without making any recursive calls.
The loop for this call to backtrack is now complete, so we return to the previous call with path=[].
The loop for the initial call to backtrack is now complete, so we return to the subsets function with result=[[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3], [2], [2, 3], [3]].
The function then returns the final result list: [[], [1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]].
So, in summary, the backtrack function recursively explores all possible paths that can be built from the input array by making recursive calls with different combinations of the remaining elements at each level of the call stack. Each time a new path is found, it is added to the result list. Once all possible paths have been explored for a given set of remaining elements, the function returns to the previous level of the call stack to explore the next possible path from that level. This process continues until all possible paths have been explored at the initial level of the call stack and the final result is returned.
